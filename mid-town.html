      <p>
        On July 2nd, <span class="red-aesthetic">The Red Aesthetic</span> will
        be performing <span class="mid-town"><s>Mid</s> / <i>Town</i></span
        >, a ritual traversal of liminal spaces throughout midtown Manhattan.
        <span class="mid-town"><s>Mid</s> / <i>Town</i></span>
        will be an intentional journey through several atria, arcades,
        passageways, and other public spaces that weave through midtown,
        breaching the manifest content of the grid system and revealing a vast
        latent network of alternative possibilities for moving through space, as
        well as the surplus aesthetics of a parallel world forged in the
        interstices of building codes, public works projects, and tax
        incentives.
      </p>
      <p>
        This journey, and its many interstitial spaces of diverse, shapes,
        sizes, colors, lighting conditions, and other architectonic qualities,
        will provide a medium to slide out of the pervasive narrative that
        induces us to perform as particular characters caught in the grid system
        of culture: shopping, working, dwelling, consuming, and ultimately
        amounting to a subject predictably driven by the teleology of normative
        destinations. Instead, we will be going nowhere but into space itself,
        exploring the possibility of being new subjects unpredictably free to
        shift through poorly-charted territories. To this end, this journey will
        involve many opportunities to experiment with moving and becoming in
        these spaces.
